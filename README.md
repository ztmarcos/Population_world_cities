#Conlusion:


I compiled a table detailing the most populated cities, and it revealed that Tokyo holds the top position, albeit with a declining rate from 2022 to 2023. Intrigued by this trend and keen on understanding the variations across other cities, I delved into identifying the top cities experiencing a decline in population.

Upon closer examination, it is noteworthy that both Japan and the United States are taking discernible actions to address this demographic challenge. The findings underscore the significance of demographic shifts and prompt a deeper exploration into the strategies implemented by these countries to manage and counteract population decline.
